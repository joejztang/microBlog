This project so far is an almost copy of The Flask Mega Tutorial

### how to run

`export FLASK_APP=microBlog.py`

`flask run`

### some issues/parts that I don't quite get clear

* total packages that being used(can record by myself later)

* circular imports

* i18n and l10n is not thorough

* decorator `app.route('\xxxx', methods=['GET', 'POST'])`, when to use get and when to use post is not clear
